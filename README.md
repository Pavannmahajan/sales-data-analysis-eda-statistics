# Sales Data Analysis for a Retail Store

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical methods. The goal is to understand sales distribution, category-wise performance, and validate assumptions using inferential statistics.

## Dataset
Synthetic sales data was generated using Python to simulate real-world retail sales across different product categories.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Analysis Performed
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation)
- Category-wise aggregation of sales
- Confidence interval estimation for mean units sold
- Hypothesis testing using one-sample t-test
- Data visualization using histograms, boxplots, and bar charts

## Key Insights
- Sales vary across different product categories
- Distribution analysis helps identify central trends and variability
- Confidence intervals provide a reliable range for average sales
- Hypothesis testing validates assumptions about sales performance

## Application
A Streamlit application was built to display analysis results and visualizations interactively.
